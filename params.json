{"name":"CellSwallow","tagline":"JavaScript game inspired by Osmos","body":"## Cell Swallow\r\nInspired by <http://osmos-game.com/> and <http://agar.io/>, Cell Swallow sets you up against a large virus. Your goal is to swallow nearby grower-cells in order to become large enough to defeat the virus before he does the same to you.\r\n\r\n### Strategy\r\nOnce the game begins, the virus will begin chasing you down. One strategy may be to swallow up the grower-cells as fast as possible. Another might be to carefully lead the virus around the play area such that it doesn't grow. Hint: the Player cell is able to wrap around the game board. See if you can use this to your advantage to defeat the Virus!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
