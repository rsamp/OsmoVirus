##OsmoVirus - [Live Version][link]
Inspired by http://osmos-game.com/ and http://agar.io/, OsmoVirus pits you up against the Virus. Your goal is to swallow nearby Silver Cells in order to grow and become large enough to defeat the Virus before he does the same to you.

###Features
Once the game begins, the player, Virus, and Silver Cells will be randomly placed on the board. Press the spacebar at any time to restart. The Virus will begin chasing you down immediately. Once you grow larger than the Virus, it will shift its attention to a Silver Cell in an effort to regain the advantage.

###Strategy
One strategy may be to swallow up the Silver Cells as fast as possible. Another might be to carefully lead the virus around the play area such that it doesn't run into any Silver Cells. Hint: the Player cell is able to wrap around the game board. See if you can use this to your advantage to defeat the Virus!
